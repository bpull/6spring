**********Data Summary*********
In this example, SRT has both the fastest response time and the fastest turnaround time.
This is most likely due to pre-emption of programs who have the least amount of time left to run.
This is probably not the best idea because the largest programs (longest service time) will get starved when many small programs come in.
